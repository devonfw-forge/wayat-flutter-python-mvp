# auto_route

Routing library that generates the boilerplate code for the default Flutter Router

## PROS
* Is just a generator of boilerplate for the default router
* Makes setting up the routes incredibly easy compared to the default option
* Great amount of options and features to decide how to handle the navigation
* Great configurability
* No added performance cost of third party libraries

## CONS
* Having to regenerate the code every time you want to update a route can be a bit tedious
* Some small detail has to be touched in the generated code (importing packages e.g.)
