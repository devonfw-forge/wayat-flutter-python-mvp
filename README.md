# What is WAYAT?

What is WAYAT? It stands for Where Are You AT, and it's a mobile app which allows people to publish their current location.

It is made with Flutter, which  provides:
- **Multiplatform** applications (mobile, web, Desktop)
- Very **short time to market**
- Great integration with **Google Cloud**

In this App people should be able to connect to “buddies” so they can connect to a network of people which shares each other's locations.

You can download the Android apk in [here](https://github.com/devonfw-forge/wayat-flutter-python-mvp/releases/latest) or access the web if you are registered by this [link](https://wayat-web-dchj7vzxga-no.a.run.app/)

# What is WAYAT for?

There are many use cases for WAYAT. This are just a few examples. Do any of them sound familiar?

- **As a Person working in hybrid mode** from Home or at the office I would
like to obtain easily the location of my “buddies” so I can determine which one I can
meet in person or where I have to go.

- **As a Person travelling alone** I would like to obtain easily the planned location of my
“buddies” so I plan where to meet them.

# Why WAYAT

Wayat is part of a larger initiative sponsored by Capgemini. It' s a bundling of separate initiatives which were merged in order to be more efficient have more impact. Part of the objectives were to:

 - create a real, useful reference app showing the power of Flutter (wayat)
 - create the back-end of way-at with [devon4py](https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devon4py/), the new Python template within devonfw. Although it' s called an "incubator" due to devonfw's release policy, the stack if mature and production ready. 
 - show the possibilities of Cloud Native development
 - show the capabilities of Google Cloud
 - demonstrate that it is possible to go from Ideation to MVP in 3-4 Sprints using the combination of Google' s technologies and Capgemini' s experience with Agile/Devops methodologies.
