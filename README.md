# WAYAT

## What is WAYAT?

What is WAYAT? It stands for Where Are You AT, and it's a mobile app which allows people to publish their current location.

In this App people should be able to connect to “buddies” so they can connect to a network of people which shares each other's locations.

## What is WAYAT for?

There are many use cases for WAYAT. This are just a few examples. Do any of them sound familiar?

- As a Person working in hybrid mode from Home or at the office I would
like to obtain easily the location of my “buddies” so I can determine which one I can
meet in person or where I have to go.

- As a Person travelling alone I would like to obtain easily the planned location of my
“buddies” so I plan where to meet them.

Check our releases if you want to start now! You just need a Google Account and automatically all your selected contacts in your addressbook that has registered to WAYAT will be able to find your location and viceversa.
